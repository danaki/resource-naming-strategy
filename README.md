Resource Naming Strategy
=======================
Resource Naming Strategy For Doctrine ORM

## Why _Resource_?
This naming strategy following the natural way of thinking about _entities_ and _resources_. Imagine that you have a __one Flower__. It's single entity. You want to store some data about __flowers__ e.g. in your database. It's _resource_.

Simple? I know resource named _flower_ sounds easier but sometimes it's more confusing. In the end, you have a lot of flowers, not one.

This strategy is similar to the _Laravel_ naming convention.
